# Welcome to the repository for SJB_NN

This is the code that is provided with the blog series - [From Zero to GPU](https://www.nomadic-hacker.com/post/sjb_nn_1/)

The code is here as a demonstration of neural network concepts and is not meant to be production-ready, there are a lot of shortcuts taken and conveniences that the author does not endorse in a production-quality code base. Intended purely as a learning aid to go with the articles

## Dependencies

* A C++14 compiler
* CMake
* [Eigen 3.3.4](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl)

Since I suck with CMake, you will have to set the location of Eigen and Intel MKL separately
