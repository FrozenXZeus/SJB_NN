# Welcome to the repository for SJB_NN

This is the code that is provided with the blog series - [From Zero to GPU](https://www.nomadic-hacker.com/post/sjb_nn_1/)

The code is here as a demonstration of neural network concepts and is not meant to be production-ready, there are a lot of shortcuts taken and conveniences that the author does not endorse in a production-quality code base. Intended purely as a learning aid
